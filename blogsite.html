	<h3> 
My top 10 self care tips and activities to keep busy and feel your best during the quarantine
</h3>

<p class="blogpost"> As you’ll soon learn, I am really big on self-care. This is even more important with the COVD-19 situation we face today. So I decided to compile a list of my top self care tips and how they help me stay sane in today’s world. <br> <br>

1. Watch some TV shows and movies <br><br>

I definitely get bored doing this all day however, I have a set list of TV shows to watch when I’m in a bad mood.  These shows include Grey’s anatomy and Schitt’s creek. <br><br>

2. Get busy <br><br>

I find that when I’m not doing anything, I tend to feel worse so, I would recommend staying busy.  Occupy your days with different activities so you don’t get bored. I took up web designing to occupy myself. I figured out that looking forward to something in the immediate future really helped with anxiety. <br><br>

3. Adult Coloring/Sketching <br><br>

To pass time, I often find myself copying sketches from the Internet or coloring. Coloring is often regarded as a children’s activity but it’s an entertaining thing to do if you don’t have enough artistic skills to paint. I also like using color by number apps when I’m really bored. <br><br>

4. Journaling <br><br>

It really helps me to be able to identify my feelings and spend time reflecting on them. It’s nice to be able to pen down your thoughts. I need to start doing this more often but when I do it, I feel great! <br><br>
 
5. Reading <br><br>

I really enjoy a good book especially at night. I like mysteries, psychology books and romance novels. I’m still collecting books and I hope to expand on my collection in the upcoming years. <br><br>

6. Mindfulness Meditation <br><br>

Guided meditations where I go to the beach are my favorite. I can’t focus without it being guided so YouTube videos are really helpful for mediations. I like to meditate before I sleep for an optimal sleep experience <br><br>

7. Music <br><br>

Music has been a constant staple in my life. Music has been there for me through long commutes and laundry days. <br><br>

8. Get up and get dressed <br><br>

This may seem basic and obvious but the days where I stay in my pajamas, I generally feel less productive than when I get dressed and put on some makeup. When you feel better, you do better! <br><br>

9. Cooking and baking <br><br>

I don’t do this one that often but when I do, it’s an absolute delight. It kills time and at the end you have a delicious treat! What’s not to like? <br><br>

10. Bubble baths and face masks <br><br>

This is a relaxation tip to have a little spa day at home. It’s always calming to pamper yourself. <br><br>

So there it is! 10 tips to weave into quarantine life.  Switching between these tips is ideal to keep it fun and interesting!<br><br>

Cheers <br>

					<h3> How to be youself: A phenomenal insight into tips for coping with 
social anxiety</h3>


		
				<p class="blogpost"> I was recently gifted a book that I really resonated with and I wanted to share why and how the book provided amazing insights for me. “How to be yourself” is a refreshing read where 
Ellen Hendrickson uses anecdotal evidence to provide tips to face the fears associated with social anxiety.  The book wasn’t the preachy “I’m a psychologist, listen to me” kind of guide that I had read before. Instead, Ellen is open and honest about her struggle with social anxiety and how she still struggles to overcome it. The tips provided in the book are practical and are applicable to anyone’s everyday life. While reading the book, I was able to think about anxiety from a different perspective and use that to see anxiety differently. <br><br>

As humans, I think we all can relate to having some level of social fear; whether it be from presentations,  high-performance anxiety, or anxiety in specific situations . Whatever level you may be on, this book offers valuable insight. <br><br>

The book is based on the principle that a little bit of anxiety is valuable because its function is to protect us from what it thinks is a dangerous situation. Like most rationale things we fear, we can get rid of it by facing it repeatedly with not-so-bad outcomes. For example, Ellen describes some of the clients she saw who asked people weird questions and realized that they weren’t being judged as much as they thought they were. This demonstrates the personal fable that we all possess about ourselves.<br><br>
			

With a look into her own and other people's social anxiety, Ellen demonstrates some of the fears that social anxiety can bring and with her reader, she reflects on how she resolved the conflict between being herself and having social anxiety. She describes this self as what you would do and who you would be without the anxiety. Ellen differentiates between being an introvert and having social anxiety which is really useful to figuring out one’s authentic self <br><br>
		
I really do recommend this book to anyone who has any level of social anxiety because it really taught me some strategies that I could use everyday. You can find this book at Amazon books or Target.<br> <br>  Happy reading! <br><br>

Cheers <br>
Vibha</p>

<h3> Little bits of me </h3>

<p class=blogpost>
Hello everyone, welcome to my blog. I'm excited to start writing so let's dive right in. To begin, let me start by introducing myself. I'm Vibha and I’m doing 2 gap years after my undergraduate degree before I start graduate school in counseling. I did my undergraduate degree in psychology and am very interested in mental health, lifestyle and now also web development. I started learning web development during the Coronavirus pandemic because I really want to be able to create cool looking websites. I also figured, why not since that was better than having nothing to do at home.

This year I’ve really been trying to work on myself. I’ve been working on fixing my sleep schedule, practicing mindfulness, volunteering (pre-corona) and spending some time with the family. I’ve also been exploring career paths that I want to do within mental health. That was one thing I was confused about for the longest time but I reached a decision and I can share that in later posts but for now I’m really excited to go to graduate school in counseling. 

I like reading books so ever so often a book review will definitely be on the agenda. I also enjoy movies and TV shows. My favorite TV show is Grey’s anatomy. I love music, makeup and traveling to different cities.  I like writing and blogging is a great way for me to merge all my passions together. I’m writing for me but I hope something in this content inspires and excites you to continue this journey with me. <br><br> Happy reading! <br><br>

Cheers<br>
Vibha </p>
